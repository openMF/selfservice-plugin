/**
 * Thread-local holder for the current notification event type.
 *
 * <p>This context is used to carry the event type name across asynchronous boundaries (e.g., into
 * {@code @Async} notification handlers). Because the underlying storage is a {@link ThreadLocal},
 * callers <strong>must</strong> ensure that the context is cleared after use to prevent memory
 * leaks in thread-pool environments.
 *
 * <h3>Recommended usage</h3>
 *
 * Use the {@link #bind(String)} helper, which returns an {@link AutoCloseable} scope that
 * automatically calls {@link #clear()} on close:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * try (NotificationContext.Scope ignored = NotificationContext.bind("LOGIN_SUCCESS")) {
 *     applicationEventPublisher.publishEvent(event);
 * }
 * // CURRENT_EVENT is guaranteed to be cleared here
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>If you use {@link #set(String)} directly, you <strong>must</strong> call {@link #clear()} in a
 * {@code finally} block:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * NotificationContext.set("LOGIN_SUCCESS");
 * try {
 *     applicationEventPublisher.publishEvent(event);
 * } finally {
 *     NotificationContext.clear();
 * }
